Multilingual AI models, such as SUTRA, play a significant role in bridging linguistic gaps and enhancing global accessibility. These models facilitate real-time translations, making information available to diverse audiences regardless of their native language. This democratization of knowledge empowers individuals and communities, enabling them to participate fully in the digital economy and access essential services. Furthermore, multilingual AI fosters inclusivity, ensuring that language barriers do not hinder collaboration and innovation on a global scale.\",\n",
